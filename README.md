# NoteSaver Application
 # NoteSaver Application Report

## Section 1: Feature Implementation Summary

I have implemented a versatile note-taking system with the following features:

1. **Note Types**: Multiple note types including TextNote, URLNote, ImageNote, and CombinedNote (which can contain multiple components of different types)
2. **CRUD Operations**: Complete create, read, update, and delete functionality for all note types
3. **Data Persistence**: Notes are stored persistently in a CSV file format
4. **API**: A system allowing interaction with the application to:
    - Create notes with different content types
    - Retrieve individual notes by ID
    - List all notes
    - Update existing notes
    - Delete notes
5. **Health Check System**: A diagnostic endpoint that provides system status information

The application follows a clean MVC architecture pattern with controllers (servlets), models (note classes), and services/repositories for business logic and persistence.

## Section 2: Design and Programming Process Evaluation

### Class Design & Architecture

I've implemented a structured system following object-oriented principles:

1. **Inheritance Hierarchy**: The `Note` abstract base class provides common attributes and behavior, while specialized note types extend this base functionality.
    
2. **Separation of Concerns**: My code separates:
    
    - **Models** (Note classes) - Focus on data representation
    - **Controllers** (Servlet classes) - Handle HTTP requests/responses
    - **Services** (NoteService) - Implement business logic
    - **Repository** (NoteRepository) - Manage data persistence
3. **Design Patterns**:
    
    - The `BaseServlet` class uses factory methods to obtain services and repositories
    - Repository pattern to handle data access
    - Service layer to handle business logic

### OO Design Practice Assessment

**Strengths**:

1. **High Cohesion**: Classes have clear, focused responsibilities (e.g., `TextNote` handles text-specific attributes)
    
2. **Low Coupling**: Components interact through well-defined interfaces, making parts relatively independent
    
3. **Encapsulation**: Private attributes with public accessors/mutators provide controlled access to object state
    
4. **Polymorphism**: The note type hierarchy allows different note types to be treated uniformly
    
5. **Composition**: The `CombinedNote` class uses composition to integrate multiple note components
    

### Overall Quality Assessment

My implementation demonstrates understanding of object-oriented design principles and Java development concepts. The application architecture shows separation of concerns and appropriate use of design patterns.

The code is structured to show how different note types are represented and managed. The persistence mechanism using CSV works well for the scope of this project.

In summary, I've created a system that successfully meets the requirements while applying good programming practices I've learned in my first year of studies.
